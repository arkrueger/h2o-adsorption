# h2o-adsorption
Numerical solution for modeling H2O adsorption on a silica column. 
Fitting process parameters using finite difference and nonlinear regression.

~~Full readme coming soon!~~ Who am I kidding? It's been a year and a half since I uploaded this. That full readme's never coming.

In lieu of a full explanation, here's a short one. I originally did this project in MATLAB but rewrote it in Python for the sanity of the reader.

Step 0: Wonder what kappa is for water adsorption on silica in a packed column. What's kappa? It's uh... the mass transfer coefficient. Or something. 

Step 1: Get silica column with color changing beads (orange -> white).

Step 2: Humidify air.

Step 3: Blow humidified air through silica column.

Step 4: Forget to turn the videocamera on and realize you have to set up the experiment again.

Step 5: Turn the videocamera on before starting the air flow.

Step 6: Stop recording once the column has completed the color change.

Step 7: Analyze the images and extract the blue values. That's the B in RGB, and what it really tells me here is whether the column is orange or white.

Step 8: For each image, take slices of the column perpendicular to the direction of gas flow, average the B value, and normalize to the brightest portion of the column. In other words, how far has the water saturation progressed up the column?

Step 9: Do a bunch of math stuff. Construct a finite difference model from a system of partial differential equations, which allows us to skip the analytical solution and solve by curve fitting! For each "guess" of the curve fit, a key parameter is supplied as a guess (this is kappa), a curve is built with the finite difference solution, and it is scored by the sum of squared differences between the experimentally generated data and the theoretical curve generated by the finite difference method. This process is repeated with different guesses of kappa until the sum of squared differences is sufficiently minimized, i.e. the guessed kappa value produces a theoretical curve that is very close in profile to the experimentally generated data.

Step 9.5: Reflect on the pain caused by Step 9. Sticks and stones _may_ break my bones but MATLAB will _always_ hurt me.

Step 10: Celebrate having found the mass transfer coefficient, present findings, and graduate college.

And here's a snippet of the original MATLAB code before I rewrote it in Python.

MATLAB, never again.
